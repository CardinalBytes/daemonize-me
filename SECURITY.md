## Supported Versions

Version support is as follows.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| master | Master is bleeding edge and thus inherently unstable |
| 0.3.x | This is the first stable version as long as it is feasible and until 1.0.0 lands it will be supported |
