## Supported Versions

Version support is as follows during this highly volatile initial development period.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| master | Master is bleeding edge and thus inherently unstable |
| tagged versions | a tagged version until a stable release due to code volatility unless stated otherwise is unsupported |
